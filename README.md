# thdta_3
This is the repository where I keep all my code from by third and last year at univeristy.
It contains material from the courses: Advanced Programming, Mobile Apllications for Android, C# and Internet of Things and People.

The repository also contains some side projects such as Kotlin, this might be moved to another repository at a later time since it's not part of any course.
